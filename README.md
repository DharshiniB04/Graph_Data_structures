# Graph_Data_structures

A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. In this repository, we provide an implementation of an undirected graph using adjacency lists.

Operations:

AddVertex: Adds a vertex to the graph.

AddEdge: Adds an edge between two vertices.

RemoveVertex: Removes a vertex from the graph.

RemoveEdge: Removes an edge between two vertices.

DFS (Depth-First Search): Traverses the graph using Depth-First Search algorithm.

BFS (Breadth-First Search): Traverses the graph using Breadth-First Search algorithm.
